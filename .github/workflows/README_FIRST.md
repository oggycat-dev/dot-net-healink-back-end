## 🎯 What Can This System Do?

### ✅ Deployment
- **Deploy all 5 services** with one click
- **Parallel builds** for faster deployment
- **Automated health checks** after deployment
- **Support dev and prod** environments

### ✅ Cost Optimization
- **Nuke dev overnight** - Save $50-60/month
- **Keep your data safe** - RDS and ECR preserved
- **One-click restore** - Redeploy anytime

### ✅ Safety
- **Cannot delete database** by accident
- **Multiple confirmations** for destructive actions
- **Automated backups** for RDS
- **Rollback capability** via image tags

## 💰 Cost Summary

| Scenario | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Dev - Full Running** | $74-94 | All services 24/7 |
| **Dev - After Nuke** | $27.50 | Data preserved |
| **Dev - Smart Usage** | $40-50 | Nuke nights/weekends |
| **Prod - Full Running** | $150-200 | Larger instances |

**Savings**: Nuke dev environment overnight → Save $60/month 💰
