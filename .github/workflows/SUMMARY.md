# 📊 Healink CI/CD Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Full Deploy Workflow** (`full-deploy.yml`)
✅ Automated deployment of all 5 microservices to AWS  
✅ Parallel Docker image builds for faster deployment  
✅ Two-layer Terraform infrastructure deployment  
✅ Health checks after deployment  
✅ Support for both dev and prod environments  

**Key Features**:

- Push Docker images to ECR with multiple tags (latest, environment, commit-sha)
- Deploy stateful infrastructure (RDS, Redis, ECR)
- Deploy application infrastructure (ECS, ALB)
- Automated health verification

**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes per full deployment

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Development Environment

#### Full Running System
| Resource | Cost/Month | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| ECS Fargate (5 services) | $30-50 | 256 CPU, 512 MB each |
| ALB (optimized to 1) | $16 | Could be $80 with 5 ALBs |

| CloudWatch Logs | $0.50 | ~1GB/month |
| **Total** | **$74-94** | |

#### After Nuke (Nights/Weekends)
| Resource | Cost/Month | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| RDS PostgreSQL | $15 | Kept running |
| Redis ElastiCache | $12 | Kept running |
| ECR Storage | $0.50 | Images preserved |
| **Total** | **$27.50** | |

#### Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Strategy 1**: Nuke dev every night
  - Savings: $60/month (working 5 days/week)
- **Strategy 2**: Use spot instances (future)
  - Savings: Additional 30-50%
- **Strategy 3**: Share single ALB across services

### Production Environment

#### Recommended Configuration
| Resource | Instance Type | Cost/Month |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| ECS Fargate (5 services) | 512 CPU, 1024 MB | $60-100 |
