## üìù Testing Scripts

### PowerShell Test Script

Create `test-content-apis.ps1`:

```powershell
# Test User APIs (No Auth)
Write-Host "Testing User APIs..." -ForegroundColor Green

$baseUrl = "http://localhost:5003"

# Test get podcasts
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$baseUrl/api/user/podcasts" -Method Get
Write-Host "‚úì GET /api/user/podcasts - $($response.totalCount) podcasts found"

# Test search
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$baseUrl/api/user/podcasts/search?keyword=test" -Method Get
Write-Host "‚úì GET /api/user/podcasts/search"

# Test Creator APIs (Auth Required)
Write-Host "`nTesting Creator APIs..." -ForegroundColor Yellow

$token = "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
$headers = @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $token"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}

try {
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$baseUrl/api/creator/podcasts/my-podcasts" -Method Get -Headers $headers
    Write-Host "‚úì GET /api/creator/podcasts/my-podcasts - $($response.totalCount) podcasts found"
} catch {
    Write-Host "‚úó Creator API test failed: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
}

# Test CMS APIs (Admin Auth Required)
Write-Host "`nTesting CMS APIs..." -ForegroundColor Cyan

try {
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$baseUrl/api/cms/podcasts/pending" -Method Get -Headers $headers
    Write-Host "‚úì GET /api/cms/podcasts/pending - $($response.totalCount) pending podcasts"
} catch {
    Write-Host "‚úó CMS API test failed: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
}

Write-Host "`nTest completed!" -ForegroundColor Green
```
